# Blaze
*PHP's built-in web server as a zero-configuration development server*

**EXPERIMENTAL PHASE**

## Installation

    npm install -g blaze


## Running the server

To run the server, navigate to directory with an index.php and run:

    blaze

Port defaults to 8888 but uou can specify it with the -p or --port flags, IE:

    blaze -p 8000


## Todo

1. Be able to serve index.html as well as index.php
2. Parse .htaccess files to handle mod_rewrite rules?
